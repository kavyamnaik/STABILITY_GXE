STABILITY_GXE: GxE Stability Analysis using Mixed Model

Project Overview:
- Implements mixed model (BLUP), AMMI, WAASB, and GGE biplot for stability analysis.

Folder Structure:
- STAB_SCRIPT/ : R scripts for analysis
- STAB_DATA/ : Input datasets
- STAB_RESULTS/ : Output results (Excel, CSV, figures)

Steps:
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Descriptive statistics
3. AMMI analysis
4. WAASB calculation
5. GGE biplot visualization

Notes:
- Ensure input data is formatted correctly.
- Figures and results are saved in STAB_RESULTS/.
- All scripts are ready to run.
